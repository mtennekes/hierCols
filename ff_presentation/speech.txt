Hi, I'm Martijn

In my previous life I was a painter.

I loved to paint beatiful trees.

Recently, I noticed that many datasets also have trees structures,

...so I thought, why not color them, with nice colors

...from the HCL color space model.

So, we present Tree Colors,

to support visual analysis.
