\opening{Dear dr. Tory, dr. Heer, and prof. Hauser,}

We would like to thank you for the conditionally acceptance of our manuscript for publication in the IEEE TVCG. Furthermore, we would like express our thankfulness towards the reviewers whose profound and insightful feedback enabled us to improve our manuscript substantially. In this letter, we summarize the changes we made to the manuscript.


First, we fixed all grammatical issues and typos addressed by the reviewers. Obviously, we rechecked to the whole document carefully on remaining grammatical errors and typos.

Next, we improved the paper regarding all the issues listed by the primary reviewer:

\begin{itemize}
\item We corrected all misleading terms addressed by the reviewers. In the revised manuscript we use the term node-link diagram where we incorrectly used the term graph. Further, we use the term labels rather than codes which has obviously a different meaning in computer science.
\item In line with Review 1 and 4, we briefly addressed the role of tree coloring in the introduction (section 1, first paragraph), and also discussed it in the discussion.
\item We better explained and clarified the algorithm: with respect to the hue fraction (last paragraph 3.1), and the permutation step (second paragraph 3.1.1)
\item Obviously, we were unable to set up another user study with more advanced tasks within this review cycle. However, we think our user study still showed some insightful results, which is also mentioned in Review 1.  In line with this reviewer, we briefly summarized the user study results in the introduction (section 1, paragraph 5). Also, describe this with one  sentense of the abstract (the last one). Furthermore, we extended the user study discussion in section 7 (5th, 6th paragraph). We recommended additional user studies as suggested by Review 3, for further research.
\item Color vision deficiency is indeed a very important aspect of information visualization. Altough we took people with color deficiencty into account in our user study (we also took
questionnairres from them, which we now mentioned in section 5.2, first paragraph),  we neglected to analyse Tree Colors in this context. We added a section on color vision deficiency (section 3.4) and added a paragraph in the discussion (section 7, second last paragraph).
\item In line with Review 4, we added a related work section (section 2) in which we include and describe the real-world examples addressed by Review 1.
\item We took care of all presentation problems addressed by Review 2.
\end{itemize}

Below we describe the other changes we made, grouped by Review.

Review 1
\begin{itemize}
\item We described the permutation step of the algorimth better, and illustrated it with a short example. The reason to chose 144 degrees over the golden angle of 137,5 degrees is that, contrary to the blog post addressed by Review 1, the angle is rounded down to the next sibling. In the case of 5 siblings, the golden angle will be rounded down to 72, resulting in the unwanted permutation order of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Notice that in most cases the golden angle and the angle of 144 degrees will be rounded down to the same angle.
\end{itemize}

Review 2
