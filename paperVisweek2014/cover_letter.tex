\opening{Dear dr. Tory, dr. Heer, and prof. Hauser,}

We would like to thank you for the conditionally acceptance of our manuscript for publication in the IEEE TVCG. Furthermore, we would like express our thankfulness towards the reviewers whose profound and insightful feedback enabled us to improve our manuscript substantially. In this letter, we summarize the changes we made to the manuscript.

First, we fixed all grammatical issues and misleading use of terminology addressed by the reviewers. Obviously, we rechecked to the whole document carefully on remaining grammatical errors and types.


Review 3: we described the permutation step of the algorimth better, and illustrated it with a short example. The reason to chose 144 degrees over the golden angle of 137,5 degrees is that in a the case of 5 siblings, the angle will be rounded down to 72, resulting in the unwanted permutation order of [1,2, 3, 4, 5]. Of course, we could make this case a special case like the 3 and 4 case.



\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
