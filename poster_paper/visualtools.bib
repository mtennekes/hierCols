	hierarchical data. Previously proposed Treemap layout algorithms
	are limited to rectangular shapes, which causes prob- lems with the
	aspect ratio of the rectangles as well as with identify- ing the
	visualized hierarchical structure. The approach of Voronoi Treemaps
	presented in this paper eliminates these problems through enabling
	subdivisions of and in polygons. Additionally, this allows for creating
	Treemap visualizations within areas of arbitrary shape, such as triangles
	and circles, thereby enabling a more exible adap- tation of Treemaps
	for a wider range of applications.}},

  title = {{Ordered and quantum treemaps: Making effective use of 2D space to
	display hierarchies}},
  journal = {ACM Trans. Graph.},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {21},
  pages = {833--854},
  number = {4},
  month = {October},
  abstract = {{Treemaps, a space-filling method for visualizing large hierarchical
	data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms
	have been previously proposed to create more useful displays by controlling
	the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While
	these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single
	layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically
	changing data, fail to preserve order of the underlying data, and
	create layouts that are difficult to visually search. In addition,
	continuous treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying fixed-sized
	objects within them, such as images.This paper introduces a new "strip"
	treemap algorithm which addresses these shortcomings, and analyzes
	other "pivot" algorithms we recently developed showing the trade-offs
	between them. These ordered treemap algorithms ensure that items
	near each other in the given order will be near each other in the
	treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials
	and from actual stock market data, we show that, compared to other
	layout algorithms, ordered treemaps are more stable, while maintaining
	relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles.
	A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance
	benefits of the new algorithms. Finally, we present quantum treemap
	algorithms, which modify the layout of the continuous treemap algorithms
	to generate rectangles that are integral multiples of an input object
	size. The quantum treemap algorithm has been applied to PhotoMesa,
	an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images.}},
