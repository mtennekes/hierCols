We propose a method to color tree- structured data to enhance visual analysis.

We use the Hue-Chroma-Luminance color space model, that is known for its nice perceptual properties.

Hue is used to differentiate the branches of the tree.

Luminance and chroma are used to encode the depth of the nodes.
